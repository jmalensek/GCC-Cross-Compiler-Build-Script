# GCC-i686-Cross-Compiler-Build-Script

This is a simple bash script that builds a cross compiler for i686 platforms using base GCC packages. It was made on Arch Linux, however it should also work on Debian based distros. To build the cross compiler, first make sure you have all the prerequisites and a stable internet connection, then simply download the script and execute it. 

For more information about what's happening in the script or cross compilers in general, see the following page:\
