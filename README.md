# GCC-i686-Cross-Compiler-Build-Script

This is a simple bash script made for Arch-based distros that builds a cross compiler for i686 platforms using base GCC packages. To build the cross compiler, first make sure you have stable internet connection, then simply download the script and execute it. 

For more information about what's happening in the script or cross compilers in general, see the following page:\
